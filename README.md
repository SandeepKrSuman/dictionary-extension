<p>It is unconventional to always open a new tab to lookup for a word's meaning while you are reading your favorite blog or when you are simply browsing and you come across a word you want to know about. This extension is here to rescue. Select a word you want to look at and click on the extension button at the top and a beautiful popup will appear with the word definition and example. Isn't this cool and conventional? Install this extension and find word definitions on the go.</p>
